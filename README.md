# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview

A Kickstarter is currently being planned for a play and the head of the Kickstarter, Louise, wants to determine trends of other Kickstarters in order to decide on better decisions and knowledge of the most likely outcomes in this Kickstarter. A large set of data of other Kickstarters has already been compiled and was organized and adjusted that so that trends that would present themselves. Many other categories were in the data as well that needed to be filitered out as they have little connection to plays and would possible influence the data so it would become inaccurate.

## Analysis and Challenges

With this information, it is suggested that the Kickstarter should start in May or June where trends start to have the highest rate of successful campaigns. It is also good to know that Play subcategory has high rate of successful Kickstarted compared
to those that cancel or fail.

A few challenges occured when organizing the data. As mentioned before, there was a lot of data that did not really relevent to the trend data needed, such as technology or music. The main focus is theatres and plays, so in order to obtain data more relevent to the purpose, any data that was not categorised as a theatre or play was filtered out in desinated charts and graphs. Besides this, there was a slight error with the creation of the "Years" column where the data would not automaticlly populate the entire column, so it was needed that I run down the rows to populate missing cells.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
