# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview

A Kickstarter is currently being planned for a play and the head of the Kickstarter, Louise, wants to determine trends of other Kickstarters in order to decide on better decisions and knowledge of the most likely outcomes in this Kickstarter. A large set of data of other Kickstarters has already been compiled and was organized and adjusted that so that trends that would present themselves. Many other categories were in the data as well that needed to be filitered out as they have little connection to plays and would possible influence the data so it would become inaccurate.

## Analysis and Challenges

With such a large set of information with the obtain dataset, it needed to be organized and filter out some of the data. A common trend in this data analysis is that the outcomes played an important factor when deciding on how to analyze the data because the outcomes are relevent to if the gaols were met, which is what the kickstarter is attempting to acheive. With this, two ideas that were taken into account was: when should the campign start and what should the gaol be? Through the data analysis, the charts above were created with filtered data so that it i only relevent to theaters and plays.

Based on the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" graph, it is suggested that the Kickstarter should start in May or June where trends start to have the highest rate of successful campaigns for the best chance of success. However, the chart representing goals suggests that the gaol used for the campign should be a lower amount to ensure success. The said amount can be argued, but perferable less than  $20,000.

A few challenges occured when organizing the data. As mentioned before, there was a lot of data that did not really relevent to the trend data needed, such as technology or music. The main focus is theatres and plays, so in order to obtain data more relevent to the purpose, any data that was not categorised as a theatre or play was filtered out in desinated charts and graphs. Besides this, there was a slight error with the creation of the "Years" column where the data would not automaticlly populate the entire column, so it was needed that I run down the rows to populate missing cells.

## Results

With the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" graph, it is suggested that the Kickstarter should start in May or June, where trends start to have the highest rate of successful campaigns reletive to other amount of failed campaigns. The other months of January to April and August to November have a similar ratio of successful outcomes to failed outcomes, but this ratio is not as desirable as the months of May to July. This is easly shown as the number of failed campigns seems to remain fairly consistant through the year, a person would need to focus on the successful campigns to track the best lauch dates in this chart.

This graph also suggests that it is very unlikly that the campaign will cancel, as all months there are less than 10 campigns that have canceled. Each month brought a number of campigns that either failed or succeeded many times more than the number of campeigns that have canceled. With this said, it is safe to say that canceling the campign is something not to take seriously into account at the moment.   

In the "Outcomes based on Goals" graph, it generally shows a decending trend of the successful outcomes as the goal amount increases. There are a few exceptions to this trend as noticed in the 35000 to 39999 and 40000 to 44999 catergories where the success rate increased a notable amount, but as the goal increases, the data becomes somewhat reliable as there is less dta to go on. This means that the graph becomes more sensitive to changes. Between these two points, there is only 9 contributing pieces of data compared to the hundreds of data found between the first 3 set out goals. The general trend is also shown at the last point where the 50000+ goal as a success rate around 10%. With this sair, the rate of success will increaseif the campaign keeps towards smaller goals.

I have noticed that, in the data, as the goals get torwards the higher end, the number of campaigns drops. This provides limitations in the accuracy of campaigns with high goals as oppose to campigns with smaller goals, esppically when filtering the data. To futher the analysis of the data, it can be use to create graphs to compare countries and their success rate, but even more, we can use the data to determine how long the compaign should last (by comparing launch dates and end dates) in order to optimize the campign.
