# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Using a set of data regarding Kickstarter campaigns was organized so that trends may be clearly shown. The category of focus
was plays (under a theater category) and thus the data was adjusted accordinglly.
With this information, it is suggested that the Kickstarter should start in May or June where trends start to have the highest
rate of successful campaigns. It is also good to know that Play subcategory has high rate of successful Kickstarted compared
to those that cancel or fail.
